    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>I was born in the Philippines but grew up in Australia. In my free time I enjoy reading - mostly fantasy and sci-fi but I am also a sucker for horror, I also play video games - some competitive games such as Valorant but mostly action-adventure games such as Dark Souls.</p>

    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>

    <p>At a young age I was pretty good with technology, or at least, I was quick at learning how to use it. I was always troubleshooting things like the home computer for my family, or things like projectors at school. I grew up taking things apart and putting them back together, and the first biggest purchases with my own money was parts to build my own computer. One of my favourite experiences of working with tech was making mods for video games such as Skyrim.</p>

    <p>I chose to study at RMIT because of its reputation as a great school for technology, as well as the many opportunities that it provides for students. These include things like events that are fantastic for industry experience and making connections. Some other things that influenced my decision to study here are the facilities and location. Finally, after reviewing other courses, I felt that RMIT provided a learning environment that reflected how the tech industry works.</p>

    <p>I expect to learn how to get my foot in the door for any type of job in technology, but mostly focusing on software. More specifically, knowledge in programming to intuitively learn any language, as well as common practices in developing software. Other skills such as designing UI, data management, and troubleshooting is also a high priority. </p>

    <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
    <h3><img src="images/idealjob.jpg" alt=""></h3>

    <p> This job is a software development position, working with a wide range of people. The position requires a high amount of creativity, problem solving, and attention to detail. What interests me the most about this position is the exposure to a Dev-Ops delivery style, which where I feel that my skills can thrive.</p>

    <p>The job requires experience in many coding languages and database management systems, such C#, Delphi, MY SQL, and Firebird, as well as experience in web and software development. Bachelor qualifications in IT or Computer Science (or other related disciplines) are also required.</p>

    <p>Since I am very much new to the IT industry, I have informal experience in coding languages such as Python and C#, but very little on database management systems. </p>

    <p>I plan to learn industry level skills through RMIT, hopefully learning enough to intuitively figure everything else out. For example, applying concepts from one programming language to another. There are also many resources that have been shown to me by my fellow peers that I plan on reviewing to round out my experience.</p>

    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>

    <h3>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator: INFJ-T</h3>
    <h3><img src="images/infj-advocate.png" alt="" height="150"></h3>

    <h3>Learning Style: Reflector Type</h3>
    <h3><img src="images/learningstyle.jpg" alt=""></h3>

    <h3>Creative Type by Adobe: The Maker</h3>
    <h3><img src="images/maker-cover.png" alt="" height="150"></h3>

    <p>These tests never paint the full picture, but they can be great at forming first impressions. Many things in the Advocate Myers-Briggs personality type has many things that I agree with, but also a few things that I disagree with, but overall it fits my personality pretty well. As for learning styles, this is a new test for me, and the results are very eye-opening. A combination of the Reflector style and Pragmatist style best describes my learning experiences. I learn best when I can sit back and really take the information in before doing something practical with it. The Maker creative type is referred to have 'focus and dedication', while I can somewhat relate, I am also a very lazy person. </p>

    <p>The INFJ-T personality type favours helping others and thrives in leadership positions. While I don't mind being the leader of a group, I would much rather not be. My learning style might mean a longer period of discussion and planning, as I may need to take more time to see the full picture. The Maker creative type dictates that while I may enjoy collaborative work, working alone on my own tasks may be best so I can focus on my own creative process.  </p>

    <p>Those with the Advocate Myers-Briggs personality type can thrive in any situation ensuring that I can make the best out of any situation. My learning type and the Maker creative type might be more influential in forming a team and choosing a project. Perhaps I should look into projects with a more involved process, or a team that is open to having longer discussions.</p>

    <h2>Project Idea</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>A companion app to Pixels Dice, found <a href="https://gamewithpixels.com/" target="_blank">here</a>, which are a set of electronic dice to be used in tabletop role playing games (TTRPG). TTRPGs will often be based around a 'character sheet' which will contain information on the player's character, such as their particular modifiers. The companion app will be based around these character sheets, allowing the Pixels Dice to interact with them and help with the mathematical aspects of TTRPGs. The app will also provide a built-in character sheet creator, and will have some functionality to help people new to TTRPGs. It will also have some functionality to integrate with other services that are already available.</p>

    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>A website used for playing table-top role playing games, Roll20, <a href="https://blog.roll20.net/posts/the-orr-report-q4-2021/" target="_blank">reported 8 million users in 2020</a>. While it is a Niche hobby, there are many people playing TTRPG's and there have been many pieces of technology that have been developed because of it, including virtual tabletop (VTT) programs and websites such as Roll20. These technologies make the games easier to play, as they aid with the visualisation and mathematic aspects of the games, resulting in a 'modern' style of playing. Despite the creation of these digital tools, many people prefer to play in a more traditional pen and paper only style, as they feel that it harms the experience of the games. With the my project, I will be attempting to bridge the gap between the traditional pen and paper style of play, to the modern style of play. </p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The target audience I have in mind for this app are people that are new to these types of games, and people that have trouble with the mathematical aspects of the game. The app will mostly support Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, <a href="https://blog.roll20.net/posts/the-orr-report-q4-2021/" target="_blank">as it is the most played game in the TTRPPG genre</a>. The app would also be great for more math heavy TTRPGs such as Pathfinder. The main feature of the app is being able to detect the numbers rolled on the Pixels Dice, and automatically add or subtract any relevant modifiers. In order to achieve this, the app and its main features will be primarily focused on interactive character sheets which holds the relevant data to interact with the Pixels Dice. Because of this, there will be many features built in dedicated to making character sheets. To support other TTRPGs, there would need to be additional support for them, as each TTRPG uses their own unique sheets. It will also have features that support importing already made character sheets. This includes online character sheet makers like DNDBeyond, or any official character sheet PDFs. Because one of the main focuses of the app will be to help those new to the hobby, the built-in character sheet maker will have an option to enable a tutorial mode, which guides the user through creating a character sheet. The user would interact with the character sheet, denoting which action and modifier they are using. Once a modifier is defined, the user would then roll the appropriate Pixels Dice. The Pixels Dice will detect the number rolled, send it to the app, which will perform the calculation and give the user the result. There will also be support for manually entering modifiers and rolls, as TTRPGs can be very spontaneous and don't have hard set rules to follow. Additionally, there will be features that allow users to store any values in case they are needed, or if multiple rolls are required (such as rolling twice and taking the higher value). TTRPGs more often than not use multiple different sided dice, and so to help new players, when a modifier or action is picked, the corresponding dice that the user needs to roll will light up. This will help newer players familiarise themselves with which die is which. TTRPGs are inherently collaborative, so there will also be options to connect with other players, allowing them to see what each other rolls, if they so choose. One criticism that VTTs get is that the tactile feeling of rolling dice is removed, as everything is digital, and often done by the click of a button, so another feature of the app will be to send data to VTTs allowing them to be used for online play. While the Pixels dice already has official support for implementing integrations to popular services such as Roll20, this app will need custom modules for these servicesâ€™ proper integration. But these features will come later as they are not the main focus of the project.</p>

    <h3>Tools and technology</h3>
    <p>The Pixels Dice will be the main piece of hardware and software that is needed. Fortunately, the creator of the Pixels Dice, Jean Simonet, is committed to keeping the API Open Source on a <a href="https://github.com/jeansimonet/Pixels" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. Not only that, but the project is also Open Hardware, with all the layouts, schematics, and a list of components available on <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/28377-pixels" target="_blank">Hackaday</a>. The app will be easily developed with the Open Source available (as well as a discord server filled with other like-minded people), but assembling the hardware requires additional equipment, such as a soldering iron, pressure pot, and other dice-making equipment. </p>

    <h3>Skills required</h3>
    <p>The software for Pixels Dice is written primarily in C, C++, and C#. The firmware is built with Nordic's nRF5 SDK. This is what is required to develop apps that work with the Dice. Most VTTs also use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON, when developing custom modules, such as one that allows for integration with this project. The Pixels Dice themselves can be bought through the Kickstarter. Developers can make their own Dice, as there are schematics and component lists on the Hackaday page. These boards require assembly, from soldering batteries to folding and gluing. Once the board has been assembled it follows dice making procedure; the board is encased in resin, put in a pressure pot, and then sanded down. Overall, developing programs for the dice requires experience in coding languages, which are fairly easy to learn. Creating the hardware may prove to be more difficult, and cost intensive.</p>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>If the project is successful, I would expect that the line between the traditional pen and paper style of play and the modern style of play gets blended. I would also expect that newer players would have an easier time learning and playing TTRPGs, due to the beginner friendly features. Older and more experienced players can also benefit from its functionality as it helps with the mathematical aspects of the games, which gets more complicated the longer you play. Despite this, the cost of Pixels Dice is very high, compared to other RPG dice that is available at local game stores.</p>
